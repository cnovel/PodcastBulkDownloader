**Podcast Bulk Downloader** is a simple soft that allows you to download all the episodes of a podcast feed in a folder.

⚠️ Several antivirus providers flag Podcast Bulk Downloader as a trojan ([see this issue](https://github.com/cnovel/PodcastBulkDownloader/issues/77)). The issue is being investigated but in the meantime, please flag the exe as false positive to your AV provider. It will greatly help me!

![PBD_GUI](img/PBD_GUI_v0.8.png)

It's fairly easy to use: fill the RSS field, click Fetch to inspect the feed.
Then fill the Folder field and click download to download the episodes.
Logs will be displayed in the bottom part and will warn you if the software ran into issues.
Check the overwrite checkbox if you want to redownload all the episodes.
Overwriting is solely based on filename, it doesn't do any checks at the moment.
If you want to download only the last N episodes, check the corresponding box and fill the number of episodes wanted.
